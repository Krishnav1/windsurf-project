## üî¥ CRITICAL FIXES (COMPLETED)

### 1. ‚úÖ KYC Upload API Enhancement
**File:** `/app/api/compliance/kyc-submit/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- Added comprehensive console logging at every step
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages

- Improved response format with upload count and timing
- Added detailed progress logging for debugging

**Benefits:**
- Easy to debug upload failures via server logs

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Database Test Data Cleanup
**Action:** SQL cleanup via Supabase MCP

**Changes Made:**
```sql
-- Deleted all placeholder test data
DELETE FROM kyc_documents WHERE file_url LIKE '%placeholder%';
```

**Result:**
- ‚úì All 4 test records for Krishna Varma deleted
- ‚úì Database now clean for fresh uploads
- ‚úì No more old test data showing on admin dashboard

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Database Constraints & Triggers
**Migration:** `add_kyc_constraints_and_triggers`

**Changes Made:**

**a) Prevent Placeholder URLs:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE kyc_documents 
ADD CONSTRAINT no_placeholder_urls 
CHECK (file_url NOT LIKE '%placeholder%');
```

**b) Validate File URLs:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE kyc_documents 
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_file_url 
CHECK (
  file_url LIKE 'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/%' OR
  file_url LIKE 'https://%.supabase.co/storage/%' OR
  file_url LIKE 'ipfs://%'
);
```

**c) Auto-Update KYC Status:**
- Created trigger function `update_kyc_status_on_upload()`
- Automatically sets user status to 'pending' when all 4 documents uploaded
- Prevents manual status manipulation

**d) Audit Logging:**
- Created trigger function `log_kyc_document_changes()`
- Automatically logs all KYC status changes
- Tracks who approved/rejected documents

**e) Performance Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_kyc_documents_user_status ON kyc_documents(user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_kyc_documents_user_type ON kyc_documents(user_id, document_type);
```

**Benefits:**
- No more test data can be inserted
- Automatic status updates
- Complete audit trail
- Faster queries

- Replaced with `<InvestorNav />` component
- Consistent navigation across all investor pages

**b) Main Navbar Component:**
- Added localStorage sync for immediate auth display
- Added storage event listener for cross-tab sync
- Fixed auth state not updating after login
- Improved error handling

**Before:**

- Main Navbar syncs with localStorage
- Consistent UX across the app

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (COMPLETED)

### 5. ‚úÖ Review Button Visibility Fix
**File:** `/app/admin/kyc/page.tsx`

**Change:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (invisible button)
className="block text-center px-3 py-2 bg-[#0B67FF] text-white text-sm rounded hover:bg-[#2D9CDB]"

// AFTER (visible button)
className="block text-center px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white text-sm rounded hover:bg-blue-700 font-medium transition-colors"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Standard Tailwind classes have better browser compatibility
