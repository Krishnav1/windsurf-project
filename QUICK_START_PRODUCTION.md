# ⚡ QUICK START - PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

1. ✅ **Database migrations applied** to Supabase
2. ✅ **All code implemented** (IPFS, encryption, blockchain)
3. ✅ **Smart contracts updated** (investor limits)

---

## 🚀 3 STEPS TO PRODUCTION

### **STEP 1: Generate Secrets (2 minutes)**

Run this command to generate production keys:

```bash
node -e "console.log('ENCRYPTION_KEY=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex')); console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'));"
```

**Save these keys securely!** You'll need them for Vercel.

---

### **STEP 2: Deploy Smart Contracts (10 minutes)**

```bash
# Make sure deployer wallet has MATIC
# Get free testnet MATIC: https://faucet.polygon.technology/

# Deploy all contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-erc3643.js --network amoy

# Copy the output addresses:
# IdentityRegistry: 0x...
# ComplianceModule: 0x...
# ERC3643Token: 0x...
```

**Save these addresses!** You'll add them to Vercel environment variables.

---

### **STEP 3: Deploy to Vercel (15 minutes)**

#### **A. Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready"
git push origin main
```

#### **B. Import to Vercel:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repo
3. Click "Deploy" (it will fail - that's OK!)

#### **C. Add Environment Variables:**

Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these (use your generated values):

```env
# Supabase (from your .env file)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://gviwynyikaaxcjjvuedg.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<from_your_env>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<from_your_env>

# Blockchain (use your deployed addresses)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_wallet_private_key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=80002
NEXT_PUBLIC_IDENTITY_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=<from_step_2>
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMPLIANCE_ADDRESS=<from_step_2>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ERC3643_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<from_step_2>

# Pinata (already have these)
PINATA_API_KEY=22633d5050ecb7456859
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=30256757e3121e9afd6ca23122d4c8227b4e96b0f4bee0e1e7c11b24940ba86b

# Secrets (from Step 1)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your_generated_key>
JWT_SECRET=<your_generated_secret>

# App URL (will be provided by Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### **D. Redeploy:**
Click "Deployments" → "Redeploy" (now it will succeed!)

---

## ✅ VERIFY DEPLOYMENT

### **Test the Flow:**

1. **Visit your Vercel URL**
2. **Register as investor**
3. **Upload KYC document** → Check console logs for IPFS hash
4. **Login as admin** (use your admin account)
5. **Approve KYC** → Check console logs for blockchain tx
6. **Verify on PolygonScan:** https://amoy.polygonscan.com/tx/YOUR_TX_HASH

---

## 🔄 UPDATING CONTRACT ADDRESSES (No Rebuild Needed!)

### **Problem:** 
Every time you deploy a new contract, you need to rebuild the app.

### **Solution: Use API Route for Config**

I've already set this up! Contract addresses are fetched from API at runtime.

**To update addresses without rebuilding:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_IDENTITY_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`
4. Click "Save"
5. **No rebuild needed!** - Server-side code uses new value immediately

**For client-side updates:**
- Frontend fetches from `/api/config` endpoint
- This reads from environment variables at runtime
- No rebuild required!

## 🛠️ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue: "Build failed on Vercel"**
**Fix:**
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# If it works locally, clear Vercel cache:
# Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Clear Build Cache
```

### **Issue: "ENCRYPTION_KEY not found"**
**Fix:**
- Check Vercel environment variables
- Make sure it's set for "Production" environment
- Redeploy after adding

### **Issue: "Blockchain registration failed"**
**Fix:**
- Check deployer wallet has MATIC
- Verify contract address is correct
- Check RPC URL is accessible

### **Issue: "IPFS upload timeout"**
**Fix:**
- Check Pinata dashboard for rate limits
- Verify API keys are correct
- Try uploading smaller file first

## 📊 MONITORING

### **Check These Daily:**

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Analytics
   - Page views
   - Error rate
   - Performance

2. **Pinata Dashboard** → https://app.pinata.cloud
   - Storage usage
   - Pin count
   - API usage

3. **PolygonScan** → Your contract address
   - Transaction history
   - Gas usage
   - Event logs

4. **Supabase Dashboard** → Database
   - Storage usage
   - Active connections
   - Query performance

## 🔐 SECURITY REMINDERS

### **NEVER commit these to git:**
- ❌ `.env` file
- ❌ Private keys
- ❌ Encryption keys
- ❌ API secrets

### **DO backup securely:**
- ✅ Encryption key (password manager)
- ✅ Deployer private key (hardware wallet)
- ✅ Database backups (Supabase auto-backup)
- ✅ Smart contract addresses (documentation)
